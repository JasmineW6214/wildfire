This repository contains the code for my "Wildfire Detection and Prediction" project.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train a sequential transformer model using satellite imagery and weather data for increased accuracy in wildfire detection and prediction.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `Data Processing/`: Contains the entire data processing pipeline. Including extraction, filtering, merging, and preprocessing.
- `Model/`: Contains the model training code.
